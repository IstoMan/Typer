Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
A room without books is like a body without a soul.
You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, Love like you'll never be hurt, Sing like there's nobody listening, And live like it's heaven on earth.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.

Not all those who wander are lost.
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
