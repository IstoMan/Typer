# Output of `go build`
# For example, if your main package is in a directory named 'myproject',
# the executable will likely be named 'myproject' (or 'myproject.exe' on Windows).
# You can ignore the specific executable if it's built in the root directory.
# For example, if your project root is 'my-app' and you build an executable named 'my-app':
# /my-app
/typer
